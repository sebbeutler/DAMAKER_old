Find you way in the package
***************************

Common contains helper classes and interfaces commonly used in the vitimage project.

- ItkImagePlusInterface provides I/O methods between the Itk "Image" format, and the IJ "ImagePlus" format
- TransformUtils provides some definitions linked to 4 x 4 linear transforms. Most of them are unused since ItkTransform encapsulate most of them
- VitiDialogs provides some helpers dialog to open transforms, images, directories, confirm messages..
- VitimageUtils holds many many helpers and should be refactored in many classes


TODO : Conversion ImagePlus / ItkImage can be optimized, with a gross copy of raw data. This modification could save time when transforming image,
as this transformation lies in the Itk Image space

TODO : Refactor VitimageUtils in smaller coherent blocks
