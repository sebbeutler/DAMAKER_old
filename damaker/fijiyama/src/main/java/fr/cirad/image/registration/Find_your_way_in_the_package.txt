***************************

registration define classes and functions to perform registration of 3d/4d/5d images
- ItkTransform is extended from org.itk.simple.Transform , and extend some of its function (viewing of dense transforms on grids).
Some functions of Transform are rewritten since the binaries of org.itk.simple distributed with ImageJ tends to be uncomplete. These
functions are mainly around reading/writing transforms, flattening dense fields, and inverting dense fields
- BlockMatchingRegistration contains setup methods for a two 3d-images registration using BlockMatching algorithm, and run it with multi-threading
- ItkRegistration encapsulate the org.itk.simple.RegistrationManager to help ImageJ users to setup and run Iconic registration with Itk
- Transform3DType is an enumeration of the common transformation families handled by the two algorithms
- The other classes are useful enumerations to define a registration strategy

TODO : Fix the threading.interrupt issues with both in order to make the Fijiyama "Abort" button definitely safe
